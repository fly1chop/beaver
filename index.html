    <h2>The Tenacious Beaver</h2>

    <p> Oh the beaver. They're a Canadian symbol. They're on the very important quarter. A legendary fried delicacy is dedicated to it's name.
      They can be cute.</p>

    <p>They're pretty talented</p>

    <p>They need teeth whitening</p>

    <p>But most of all, they're tenacious beings.</p>

      I have a personal history with beavers. No. I don't have a pet beaver. (Pretty sure that could be illegal) I just had a highschool
      English teacher who was obsessed with them. She admired their tenacity and wanted us to remember the beavers in our life and when
      things get hard. Whenever time allowed it, she whipped out her ukulele, perched on a stool, and started singing all songs, every song
      about beavers. It was ridiculous then and it still is, but amazingly the image of the tenacious beavers have stuck by me since then.
      That is why I deemed it appropriate to dedicate my first project in website developing to the beavers. Go Beavers!
